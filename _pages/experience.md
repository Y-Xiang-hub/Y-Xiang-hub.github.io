# Project

* **Research on Illicit Bitcoin Addresses** (*Team Leader & Major Contributor*)
  * *BABD: A Bitcoin Address Behavior Dataset for Pattern Analysis*
    * This paper presents three contributions. Firstly, we introduce a framework for building a Bitcoin transaction graph using a directed heterogeneous multigraph and analyzing address nodes. Secondly, we compile a dataset called [BABD-13](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lemonx/babd13), which has 13 types of Bitcoin addresses, 544,462 labeled data, and 5 categories of indicators with 148 features. We evaluate common machine learning models using BABD-13 and obtain an accuracy between 93.24% and 97.13%. Thirdly, we propose a new method to extract structural features by generating k-hop subgraphs for an address node from the Bitcoin transaction graph. They summarize several behavior patterns of different Bitcoin addresses based on the experimental results for future work.
  * *Leveraging Subgraph Structure for Exploration and Analysis of Bitcoin Address*
    * This article proposes the first Bitcoin address subgraph dataset called [BASD-8](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lemonx/basd8), which contains 3,830 labeled Bitcoin transaction subgraphs, providing the structural perspective for different types of Bitcoin addresses. We explore patterns of Bitcoin addresses using complex network, machine learning, and empirical analysis. We use the graph neural network (GNN) model to perform a graph-level multi-classification task on Bitcoin address subgraphs. We also find and compare specific patterns of eight common types of Bitcoin addresses, explaining them based on empirical analysis.
  * *An Illicit Bitcoin Address Analysis Scheme Based on Subgraph Evolution*
    * We propose a novel framework for analyzing Bitcoin addresses in their subgraphs with an evolution perspective, which includes empirical analysis and machine learning-based analysis.
    * We implement an empirical analysis of the average quantity and average numerical relationship of address/transaction nodes in the 4-hop subgraphs in ten continuous periods.
    * We propose a [110-dimensional feature set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lemonx/bitcoin-subgraph-evolution-data) of a Bitcoin address in a 4-hop subgraph, additionally, based on the proposed feature set, we apply machine learning models to classify the different types of addresses and the highest accuracy rate reaches 0.95.
  * *BTC-Shadow: An Analysis and Visualization System for Exposing Implicit Behaviors in Bitcoin Transaction Graphs*
    * Pending.

* **Research on Blockchain-based Decentralized Big Data Transaction** (*Major Contributor*)
  * *A Multi-type and Decentralized Data Transaction Scheme Based on Smart Contracts and Digital Watermarks*
    * We propose a flexible scheme for data copyright protection in data sharing by using watermark-based policies, e.g., minimizing the risk of re-selling of partial, combined, and/or leaked data.
    * We propose dedicated algorithms and protocols for automatically guaranteeing data sharing fairness and pro-actively protecting data copyright in data transactions by using smart contracts.
  * *FAPS: A Fair, Autonomous and Privacy-Preserving Scheme for Big Data Exchange Based on Oblivious Transfer, Ether Cheque and Smart Contracts*
    * Our smart contract-based data trading scheme, buyers and sellers can fairly and autonomously complete transaction(s) without involving any third-party entity. In addition, we use time limits to realize trading timing control.
    * We apply m-out-of-n oblivious transfer protocol on the transactions to achieve enhanced privacy and security.
    * We propose a novel Ether cheque system to achieve fairness and autonomy, which is also more user-friendly.

* **Research on Deep Learning Security and Privacy Preservation** (*Major Contributor*)
  * *A Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Scheme Using Label-based Pixel Block Mixing for Image Classification in Deep Learning*
    * We propose a novel approach based on the pixel block mixing algorithm to prevent image data privacy leakage in deep learning training. 
    * We then evaluate the effectiveness of our scheme by comparing the training results from the original training set and the mixed training set from the same dataset with the same deep learning model structures and parameters. 
    * We also apply data augmentation to the mixed training set, transformed by the pixel block mixing algorithm, to improve the training effect for the deep learning models.
  * *Generating Image Adversarial Examples by Embedding Digital Watermarks*
    * We propose an improved Patchwork watermarking algorithm based on discrete wavelet transform (DWT) with a set of hyperparameters for efficiently generating image adversarial examples, the source code is available on GitHub.
    * We propose a novel watermarking algorithm-based framework to generate adversarial examples, which consists of three essential modules and two kinds of datasets.
    * We can see from the experimental results that the success rate can achieve an average of 95.47% on the CIFAR-10 dataset while the processing speed of each image is an average of 1.17 seconds.
    * We also propose the modified discrete cosine transform (DCT) based Patchwork watermarking algorithm. 

* **Research on Crowdsourcing Mechanism Based on Smart Contract** (*Major Contributor*)
  * *CVT: A Crowdsourcing Video Transcoding Scheme Based on Blockchain Smart Contracts*
    * We propose four essential components for achieving crowdsourcing video transcoding tasks, including the employer, the worker, the task allocation mechanism, and the payment mechanism.
    * We design a kind of smart contract combined with our proposed four components that can realize the bidding function and task execution function at the same time during the crowdsourcing video transcoding process.
