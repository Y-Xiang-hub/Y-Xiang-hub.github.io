Project
======

* **Research on Big Data Fair Transaction** (*Major Contributor*)
  * A decentralized copyright protection scheme for big data transactions based on smart contracts and digital watermarking is proposed to achieve fair big data transactions in a centralized environment, while protecting the copyright of the data being traded.
  * A smart contract for decentralized big data transactions with five algorithmic modules (transaction execution module, transaction verification module, transaction reporting module, watermark verification module and watermark reporting module) is implemented in Solidity on Ethereum with cryptographic approaches.
  * Using digital watermarking technology combined with smart contracts designed to prevent unauthorized data resale, including resale of partial data, resale of combined data and data leakage, to protect data copyright.

* **Research on Privacy Preservation of Big Data Transaction** (*Major Contributor*)
  * A decentralized privacy preservation scheme for big data transactions based on oblivious transfer protocol and smart contracts is proposed, which achieves the preservation of user privacy in big data transactions in a decentralized environment.
  * The fairness, autonomy and time control of big data transactions are implemented with Solodity in combination with the oblivious transfer protocol on Ethereum.
  * The oblivious transfer protocol preserves the privacy of both sides of the transaction by chunking the big data in a decentralized environment, i.e., the buyer cannot know all the data owned by the seller, and the seller cannot know what data the buyer has purchased.
