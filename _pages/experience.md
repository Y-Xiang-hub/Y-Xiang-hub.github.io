Project
======
* **Research on Big Data Fair Transaction** (*Major Contributor*)
  * A decentralized copyright protection scheme for big data transactions based on smart contracts and digital watermarking is proposed to achieve fair big data transactions in a centralized environment, while protecting the copyright of the data being traded.
  * A smart contract for decentralized big data transactions with five algorithmic modules (transaction execution module, transaction verification module, transaction reporting module, watermark verification module and watermark reporting module) is implemented in Solidity on Ethereum with cryptographic approaches.
  * Using digital watermarking technology combined with smart contracts designed to prevent unauthorized data resale, including resale of partial data, resale of combined data and data leakage, to protect data copyright.
