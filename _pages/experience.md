Project
======

* **Research on Big Data Fair Transaction** (*Major Contributor*)
  * A decentralized copyright protection scheme for big data transactions based on smart contracts and digital watermarking is proposed to achieve fair big data transactions in a centralized environment, while protecting the copyright of the data being traded.
  * A smart contract for decentralized big data transactions with five algorithmic modules (transaction execution module, transaction verification module, transaction reporting module, watermark verification module and watermark reporting module) is implemented in Solidity on Ethereum with cryptographic approaches.
  * Using digital watermarking technology combined with smart contracts designed to prevent unauthorized data resale, including resale of partial data, resale of combined data and data leakage, to protect data copyright.

* **Research on Privacy Preservation of Big Data Transaction** (*Major Contributor*)
  * A decentralized privacy preservation scheme for big data transactions based on oblivious transfer protocol and smart contracts is proposed, which achieves the preservation of user privacy in big data transactions in a decentralized environment.
  * The fairness, autonomy and time control of big data transactions are implemented with Solodity in combination with the oblivious transfer protocol on Ethereum.
  * The oblivious transfer protocol preserves the privacy of both sides of the transaction by chunking the big data in a decentralized environment, i.e., the buyer cannot know all the data owned by the seller, and the seller cannot know what data the buyer has purchased.

* **Research on Crowdsourcing Mechanism Based on Smart Contract** (*Major Contributor*)
  * A smart contract-based video transcoding crowdsourcing solution is proposed to achieve decentralized video transcoding and on-demand crowdsourcing, significantly reducing the video transcoding overhead.
  * Using Solidity to implement a smart contract on Ethereum with both bidding and task execution parts, and a private chain is built locally to test the designed smart contract.
  * The task allocation and payment mechanisms are designed to ensure the interests of both parties and encourage their participation in crowdsourcing.
  * The solution is suitable for most crowdsourcing scenarios of multimedia file processing (e.g. audio, etc.) with strong portability.

* **Research on Deep Learning Adversarial Example Generation Method** (*Major Contributor*)
  * A method is proposed to efficiently generate adversarial examples by adjusting the strength and number of embedded digital watermarks.
  * The proposed method achieves a success rate of more than 90\% and up to 98.07\% on the CIFAR-10 dataset against DenseNet121, GoogLeNet, MobileNets, ResNet18, ResNet50 VGG16 and VGG19.
  * An adversarial example generation system based on digital watermarking is implemented using MATLAB and Python.

* **Research on Privacy Preservation of Deep Learning** (*Major Contributor*)
  * A pixel block blending algorithm is proposed for privacy preserving the training set images (especially face images) during the training process while maintaining the usability of the training set.
  * ResNet101, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB0 models are implemented with TensorFlow's Keras API to test the training dataset with different privacy protection levels, and it is found that the trained models can still maintain some usability while preserving the image privacy.

* **Research on Pattern Recognition of Bitcoin Abnormal Addresses** (*Team Leader & Major Contributor*)
  * Constructing a dataset containing bitcoin transactions for the period July 12, 2019 to May 26, 2021, which contains 13 bitcoin addresses with 148 features and 544,462 addresses.
  * Proposing 132 statistical features and 16 structural features that need to be extracted from the Bitcoin transaction graph.
  * Building an algorithm for bitcoin transaction graph generation in Python using NetworkX. The generated graph type is directed multiple heterogeneous graph in order to reduce the information loss during graph construction.
  * Building a crawler in selenium to crawl a large amount of bitcoin ledger data without interruption, and designed the visualization interface.
  * Experiment with machine learning models in scikit-learn to classify the constructed dataset with anomalous nodes, and the classification accuracy reaches 93.24% to 97.13% on K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, random forest, multi-layer perceptron, and XGBoost.
  * The feature importance is analyzed using scikit-learn and the data distribution of specific features was studied and analyzed using visualization tools.
