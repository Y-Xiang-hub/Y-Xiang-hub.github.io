# Project

* **Research on Illicit Bitcoin Addresses** (*Team Leader & Major Contributor*)
In various studies, we extensively explored the analysis of illicit Bitcoin addresses. We introduced a framework that utilizes a directed heterogeneous multigraph to analyze Bitcoin transaction graphs, resulting in the [BABD-13](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lemonx/babd13) dataset, which classifies Bitcoin addresses with up to 97.13% accuracy. Additionally, we unveiled the first Bitcoin address subgraph dataset, [BASD-8](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lemonx/basd8), and utilized graph neural networks for transaction pattern recognition. We further innovated by [examining Bitcoin address subgraphs evolutionarily](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lemonx/bitcoin-subgraph-evolution-data), achieving a 95% accuracy rate in address type classification. Lastly, our BTC-Shadow tool offers a novel approach to visualize Bitcoin transactions, emphasizing hidden behaviors and efficient network analysis through innovative graph reduction methods.

* **Research on Blockchain-based Decentralized Big Data Transactions** (*Major Contributor*)
In two distinct studies, we delved into advanced data transaction schemes rooted in smart contracts. The first paper presents a watermark-based approach to protect data copyright during sharing, effectively preventing unauthorized resale and leakage. This approach integrates specific algorithms and protocols to ensure fairness in data sharing. Meanwhile, in the second paper, we introduce FAPS, a data trading mechanism that ensures transaction fairness and autonomy between parties without external intermediaries. This scheme capitalizes on time-regulated trading, the m-out-of-n oblivious transfer protocol for bolstered privacy, and an innovative Ether cheque system to further fairness and autonomy.

* **Research on Security and Privacy Preservation in Deep Learning Models** (*Major Contributor*)
In the realm of deep learning and image privacy, we've introduced a pixel block mixing algorithm designed to avert potential privacy breaches during training, evaluated by juxtaposing results from both original and mixed training sets. Furthermore, our focus on image watermarking led to the creation of an enhanced Patchwork watermarking technique utilizing both the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and a modified discrete cosine transform (DCT). This innovation not only efficiently produces image adversarial examples but also boasts a notable 95.47% success rate on the CIFAR-10 dataset, with a swift average processing time of 1.17 seconds per image. The core algorithm's source code has been open-sourced on GitHub.

* **Research on Crowdsourcing Mechanism Based on Smart Contracts** (*Major Contributor*)
In this work, we propose four essential components for achieving crowdsourcing video transcoding tasks: the employer, the worker, the task allocation mechanism, and the payment mechanism. We then design a smart contract that combines these four components to realize the bidding function and task execution function simultaneously during the crowdsourcing video transcoding process.
