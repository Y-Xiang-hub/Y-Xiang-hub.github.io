Project
======

* **Research on Big Data Fair Transaction** (*Major Contributor*)
  * We propose a flexible scheme for data copyright protection in data sharing by using watermark-based policies, e.g., minimizing the risk of re-selling of partial, combined, and/or leaked data.
  * We propose dedicated algorithms and protocols for automatically guaranteeing data sharing fairness and pro-actively protecting data copyright in data transactions by using smart contracts.

* **Research on Privacy Preservation of Big Data Transaction** (*Major Contributor*)
  * Our smart contract-based data trading scheme, buyers and sellers can fairly and autonomously complete transaction(s)
without involving any third-party entity. In addition, we use time limits to realize trading timing control.
  * We apply m-out-of-n oblivious transfer protocol on the transactions to achieve enhanced privacy and security.
  * We propose a novel Ether cheque system to achieve fairness and autonomy, which is also more user-friendly

* **Research on Crowdsourcing Mechanism Based on Smart Contract** (*Major Contributor*)
  * We propose four essential components for achieving crowdsourcing video transcoding tasks, including the employer, the worker, the task allocation mechanism, and the payment mechanism.
  * We design a kind of smart contract combined with our proposed four components that can realize the bidding function and task execution function at the same time during the crowdsourcing video transcoding process.

* **Research on Deep Learning Adversarial Example Generation Method** (*Major Contributor*)
  * Pending

* **Research on Privacy Preservation of Deep Learning** (*Major Contributor*)
  * We propose a novel approach based on the pixel block mixing algorithm to prevent image data privacy leakage in deep learning training. 
  * We then evaluate the effectiveness of our scheme by comparing the training results from the original training set and the mixed training set from the same dataset with the same deep learning model structures and parameters. 
  * We also apply data augmentation to the mixed training set, transformed by the pixel block mixing algorithm, to improve the training effect for the deep learning models.

* **Research on Pattern Recognition of Bitcoin Abnormal Addresses** (*Team Leader & Major Contributor*)
  * We present a general framework that can be used to build a Bitcoin transaction graph by the directed heterogeneous multigraph and analyze address nodes from the graph. We then collect and compile Bitcoin transactions that occur between 12 July 2019 and 26 May 2021 into a dataset (hereafter referred to as BABD-13), which can be found on Kaggle. The latter has 13 types of Bitcoin addresses, 544,462 labeled data, and 5 categories of indicators with 148 features. 
  * We then use BABD-13 as the baseline dataset to evaluate common machine learning models (i.e., k-nearest neighbors algorithm, decision tree, random forest, multilayer perceptron, and XGBoost). Findings from the evaluations suggest that the accuracy obtained ranges between 93.24% and 97.13%. 
  * To extract the structural features, we also propose a novel method to generate k-hop subgraph for an address node from the entire Bitcoin transaction graph built by the directed heterogeneous multigraph. Finally, we simply summarize the several behavior patterns of different Bitcoin addresses according to the experimental results as the basis of future work.
